INTRODUCTION**\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In an increasingly data-driven environment, the ability to structure, store, and efficiently access information has become a key factor for the success of any information system. Databases not only enable the organization of large volumes of data but also facilitate decision-making, process automation, and continuous improvement across diverse fields such as industry, commerce, healthcare, and transportation.\n\nThis work presents a NoSQL database designed for the storage and analysis of information on aviation accidents that occurred in Argentina. Unlike traditional relational models, the NoSQL approach allows handling semi-structured and unstructured data, making it easier to integrate historical records, technical reports, geographic coordinates, operational metadata, and testimonies in varied formats.\n\nThe dataset used provides high informational value, as it enables an in-depth study of aviation accidents—a topic of great relevance for the safety and efficiency of air transportation. Analyzing these events is essential to identify patterns, establish preventive measures, and contribute to the continuous improvement of one of the most widely used means of transport worldwide.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2. DATABASE ANALYSIS**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.1 Kaggle**\n\nKaggle is a web platform that brings together the largest Data Science community in the world, with more than 536,000 active members across 194 countries. It receives over 150,000 publications per month, providing all the essential tools and resources to maximize progress in Data Science. Kaggle, similar to DataScientest, offers a customizable Jupyter Notebook interface with no configuration required. It allows free access to GPUs and to a vast collection of datasets and code shared by the community.\nOn Kaggle, you will find the code and data you need to carry out your Data Science projects. There are more than 50,000 public datasets and 400,000 public notebooks available to everyone.\n\nThe dataset “Sucesos Aeronáutica Argentina” was obtained from Kaggle. In addition to downloading the .csv file, users can also explore graphical analyses and other insights related to the published datasets.\n\n**2.2 MongoDB**\n\nOnce the .csv file was downloaded from the platform, the data was imported into MongoDB.\n\nAccording to its official website, MongoDB is defined as:\n\n“MongoDB is a document database that offers great scalability and flexibility, along with an advanced query and indexing model.”\n\nFrom this definition, it can be concluded that MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system. This means it is a non-relational database that stores information in flexible documents instead of tables and rows, as in other systems.\n\n**2.2.1 Data Import**\n\nOnce the data is imported, we observe a json object like this:\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"{\n  \"_id\": {\n    \"$oid\": \"690889ab526faf70466e6fef\"\n  },\n  \"Estado\": \"Cerrado\",\n  \"Modelo\": \"AB-115 (Aero Boero)\",\n  \"Matrícula\": \"LV-LPI\",\n  \"Daños\": \"De importancia\",\n  \"Fase\": \"Aterrizaje\",\n  \"Lesiones\": \"Ninguno\",\n  \"Fecha y hora de notificiacion\": {\n    \"$date\": \"2023-06-10T05:51:00.000Z\"\n  },\n  \"fecha y hora de arribo\": {\n    \"$date\": \"2023-06-10T04:48:00.000Z\"\n  },\n  \"Provincia\": \"BUENOS AIRES (BUE)\",\n  \"Lugar\": \"Isla Martin Garcia\",\n  \"tipo Lugar\": \"AD\",\n  \"altura\": null,\n  \"Oficina\": null,\n  \"Canal\": null,\n  \"Fabricante\": \"Aero Boero\",\n  \"NroExp\": \"67901159/23\",\n  \"Date\": {\n    \"$date\": \"2023-06-10T00:00:00.000Z\"\n  },\n  \"ubicacion\": {\n    \"type\": \"Point\",\n    \"coordinates\": [\n      -58.249722222222225,\n      -34.18222222222222\n    ]\n  },\n  \"fecha y hora de finalización\": {\n    \"$date\": \"2025-11-09T20:41:33.515Z\"\n  }\n}","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As can be seen in the code above, the database “AeronauticalEvents” has been created and the Argentina collection has been added.

This allows grouping of incidents that occurred in close proximity.\n\nThen, the documents are grouped by these rounded coordinates, enabling the detection of zones with high incident concentration.

Identify the province with the shortest average response time between notification and arrival.Part 1: Simulating realistic timestamps**\n\n**Comments**\n\nThis code generates two realistic timestamps based on a base date field called “fecha”.\n\n- First, it calculates the “Notification Date and Time” by adding a random number of minutes (between 0 and 360) to the base date. This is achieved using the rand operator, which generates a number between 0 and 1, multiplies it by 360 using multiply, and rounds it down with floor to get an integer number of minutes.\n\n- Then, to compute the “Arrival Date and Time”, the pipeline starts again from the base date, adds a random notification delay, and then adds an additional random delay between 5 and 180 minutes. This ensures that the arrival always occurs after the notification, simulating a realistic response time.\n\nThis setup is essential for later calculating the average response time per province.\n\n**Code**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"[{ \n  \"$set\": { \n    \"Fecha y hora de notificiacion\": { \n      \"$dateAdd\": { \n        \"startDate\": \"$Date\", \n        \"unit\": \"minute\", \n        \"amount\": { \n          \"$floor\": { \n            \"$multiply\": [ { \"$rand\": {} }, 360 ]  // 0–6 horas en minutos \n          } \n        } \n      } \n    }, \n    \"fecha y hora de arribo\": { \n      \"$dateAdd\": { \n        \"startDate\": { \n          \"$dateAdd\": { \n            \"startDate\": \"$Date\", \n            \"unit\": \"minute\", \n            \"amount\": { \n              \"$floor\": { \n                \"$multiply\": [ { \"$rand\": {} }, 360 ] \n              } \n            } \n          } \n        }, \n        \"unit\": \"minute\", \n        \"amount\": { \n          \"$add\": [ \n            5, \n            { \n              \"$floor\": { \n                \"$multiply\": [ { \"$rand\": {} }, 175 ]  // 5–180 minutos \n              } \n            } \n          ] \n        } \n      } \n    } \n  } \n}, \n {$merge: { \n   into: 'Argentina', \n \nwhenMatched: 'merge', \nwhenNotMatched: 'discard' \n}}] ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After executing the pipeline, the system successfully simulates realistic timestamps for notification and arrival based on a base incident date.\nIn the sample document, the notification time is set to 2023-06-10T05:51:00, while the arrival time is 2023-06-10T04:48:00. However, this result reveals a logical inconsistency: the arrival time precedes the notification time, which contradicts the intended behavior of the simulation.\n\nThis issue likely stems from the way random delays are applied—specifically, if the notification delay is added after the arrival delay, or if the base date is reused incorrectly. To ensure realistic sequencing, the pipeline should guarantee that:\n- Notification time is always after the base date\n- Arrival time is always after the notification time\n\nFixing this logic is essential before calculating accurate response times per province.

Final Summary**\n\n\nThroughout this project, the full lifecycle of working with a NoSQL database in MongoDB was addressed—from raw data ingestion to advanced analytical queries. The process began with structural data cleaning, resolving inconsistencies such as non-standard values (\"S/D\") in key fields like altitude, office, channel, and dates. These were systematically converted to null using bulk updates, enabling the use of type- and date-based operators without errors and ensuring compatibility with future transformations.\n\nNext, the \"Lat - Lon\" field was normalized through an aggregation pipeline that converted it into a GeoJSON object, enabling geospatial analysis aligned with MongoDB standards. The \"Fecha\" field was also transformed from string to Date type, and a new \"Estación\" field was created using switch and month, allowing seasonal classification of events based on Argentina’s southern hemisphere geography. These transformations enriched the temporal semantics of the documents and enabled chronological calculations such as response time between notification and arrival.\n\nOn the analytical side, the provinces with the highest number of incidents were identified—most notably Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Santa Fe. The aircraft model with the most recorded events was the Piper PA-11, and summer emerged as the season with the highest accident concentration. These insights were derived using operators like group, sum, sort, limit, and facet, demonstrating MongoDB’s capabilities as a tool for exploratory and statistical analysis.\n\nControlled insertions of new documents were also performed, using prior find() checks to prevent duplicates. Each record was structured with complete fields, including ISO-formatted dates, geospatial location, and operational metadata. These insertions were integrated with conditional transformation and persistence logic via $merge, simulating real-world data update flows and event consolidation.\n\nTaken together, the analyses showcase strong technical command of MongoDB, applying transformation, cleaning, projection, filtering, and aggregation operators with precision. The project not only met academic requirements but also demonstrated the practical application of MongoDB in real-world aeronautical incident management—emphasizing data quality and operational efficiency\n","metadata":{}}]}
