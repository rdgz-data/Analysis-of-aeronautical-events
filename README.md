# Aeronautical Incidents in Argentina – MongoDB & Data Cleaning

This project analyzes aeronautical accidents in Argentina using **MongoDB** to import, clean, and query data sourced from Kaggle, and **Tableau** to design interactive dashboards that visualize the findings.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Normalize data imported from CSV (dates, coordinates, missing values).
- Perform queries to identify patterns:
  - Provinces with the highest concentration of accidents.
  - Most frequent aircraft models and manufacturers involved.
  - Seasonality of incidents.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- MongoDB Compass & Shell
- Kaggle datasets
- Tableau

## 📊 Key Findings
- Buenos Aires has the highest number of accidents.
- The **PA-11 (Piper)** model is the most recurrent.
- Most accidents occur in **summer** (southern hemisphere).
